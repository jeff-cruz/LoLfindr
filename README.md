# LoLfindr
A full stack JavaScript application for League of Legends players to find other League of Legends players to play with.

As a League of Legends (LoL) player, playing with friends is fun, but when I didn't have friends to play with, it didn't feel as fun. I wanted to build my first full stack project relating to LoL to have players visit the app and create their own accounts to find other people to play with!
